# 6 Synchronization
Page 257 in book

### 6.1 Background
Programs may execute on multiple threads, and a single processor may be rapidly switching between processes. This chapter deals with how parallel execution can create problems with shared data between processes.

#### The Problem
Given some variable count. Thread one is doing count++, and thread two is doing count--. Suppose the instructions get interweaved:
```
T0: producer execute register1 = count {register1 = 5}
T1: producer execute register1 = register1 +1 {register1 = 6}
T2: consumer execute register2 = count {register2 = 5}
T3: consumer execute register2 = register2 âˆ’1 {register2 = 4}
T4: producer execute count = register1 {count = 6}
T5: consumer execute count = register2 {count = 4}
```
The result should be 5++ = 6, 6-- = 5, but instead since we get 4. This is called a _race condition_, where two threads are attempting to manipulate the same data concurently. To prevent this, we need to make sure only one process at a time can modifiy any particular variable (here, count). We call this **process synchronization**.
### 6.2 Critical Section
Programs are split into sections:
1. **The Entry Section**, where the program request access to enter the critical section.
2. **The Critical Section** is the section that concenrs modifying or accessing data shared with at least one other process.
3. **The Exit Section** (_may be optional_), is principly concerned with critical section access, similar to the inverse of the entry section. 
4. **The Remainder Section**, which is simply the rest of the code.

The **critical section**  The difficult problem is making sure that _only one process_ at a time is allowed to execute in it's critical section.

The book goes on to note 3 criteria that a solution to this problem must maintain (some bits paraphrased, page 260-261):

> 1. Mutual exclusion. Only one process can execute in it's critical section at a time.
> 2. Progress. If no process is executing in its critical section and some processes
wish to enter their critical sections, then only those processes that
are not executing in their remainder sections can participate in deciding
which will enter its critical section next, and this selection cannot be
postponed indefinitely.
> 3. Bounded waiting. There exists a bound, or limit, on the number of times
that other processes are allowed to enter their critical sections after a
process has made a request to enter its critical section and before that
request is granted.

*Note*: The problem is easily avoidable on a single core enviorment by making sure that no interrupt can occur while in the critical section. Thus, a particular sequence of instructions could execute without problem. However, on multiple core systems this solution dissolves.

### 6.3 Peterson's Solution
*Note* Peterson's solution may not necessarily work on modern architecture. It is presented as a conceptual element.

The two processes share two variables:
```cpp
int turn;
boolean flag[2];
```
