# Hello
This is a repo dedicated to being a collection of notes for CS3080. This is ideally a cliff-notes style summary of relevant content from in-class lectures and textbook material.

If you want to access the repo to add content (because I honestly can't pay attention in class), please shoot me an email or message me on Discord.

Br,
-Andrew
