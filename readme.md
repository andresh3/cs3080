# Hello
This is a repo dedicated to being a collection of notes for CS3080. This is ideally a cliff-notes style summary of relavent content from in-class lecture and textbook material.

If you want to access to the repo to add content (because I honestly cba to pay attention in class) please shoot me an email or message me on discord.

Br,
Andrew
