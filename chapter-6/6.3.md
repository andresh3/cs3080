*Note* Peterson's solution may not necessarily work on modern architecture. It is presented as a conceptual element.

The two processes share two variables:
```cpp
int turn;
boolean flag[2];
```
For the following code, please note that the variable *i* refers to the current process, and *j* refers to the other. (If i=0 then j=1, or if j=1 then i=0).
```cpp
while (true) {
    flag[i] = true; // flag bit for currrent process
    turn = j; 
    
    while (flag[j] && turn == j)
        ; /* wait */
    /* critical section goes here */
    // Exit section:
    flag[i] = false;
    /*remainder section goes here. */
}
```
In my opinion the best way to process this code imo is to write it out, I suggest working it out for yourself, pen and paper like the mathematician you wish you were.
```
Process 1: Sets flag[0] to 1
Process 2: sets flag[1] to 1
Process 1: sets turn to 1
Process 2: Sets turn to 0 // flag = [1,1] turn=0
Process 1: is flag[1]==1 and turn==1? No->Continue
Process 2: is flag[0]==1 and turn==0? Yes->Do Nothing
Process 1: Does Critical Memory Modification
Process 2: is flag[0]==1 and turn==0? Yes->Do Nothing
Process 1: sets flag[0]==0 
Process 2: is flag[0]==1 and turn==0? No->Continue
Process 1: Does remainder section stuff
Process 2: Does critical section
