*Note* Peterson's solution may not necessarily work on modern architecture. It is presented as a conceptual element.

The two processes share two variables:
```cpp
int turn;
boolean flag[2];
```
For the following code, please note that the variable *i* refers to the current process, and *j* refers to the other. (If i=0 then j=1, or if j=1 then i=0).
```cpp
while (true) {
    flag[i] = true; // flag bit for currrent process
    turn = j; // Step (1)
    
    while (flag[j] && turn == j) // Step (2)
        ; /* wait */
    /* critical section goes here */
    // Exit section:
    flag[i] = false; // Step (3)
    /*remainder section goes here. */
}
```

It is divided into 3 steps:

(1) Indicate that current thread wants to access memory, and give turn to other process first.
(2) Wait until either turn is given to current process, or the other process does not want to access memory.
(3) Indicate that process is done with memory allowing other process to use it. 

In my opinion, the best way to process this code imo is to write it out, I suggest working it out for yourself, pen and paper like the mathematician you wish you were.
```
Process 1: Sets flag[0] to 1
Process 2: sets flag[1] to 1
Process 1: sets turn to 1
Process 2: Sets turn to 0 // flag = [1,1] turn=0
Process 1: is flag[1]==1 and turn==1? No->Continue
Process 2: is flag[0]==1 and turn==0? Yes->Do Nothing
Process 1: Does Critical Memory Modification
Process 2: is flag[0]==1 and turn==0? Yes->Do Nothing
Process 1: sets flag[0]==0 
Process 2: is flag[0]==1 and turn==0? No->Continue
Process 1: Does remainder section stuff
Process 2: Does critical section
...
```
