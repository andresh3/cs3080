### Unix Semaphore Primitives

- Creates a Semaphore
- Initialize a semaphore
- Wait and signal operations
- Uncreate/remove the group



#### Slide  6

Author Comment: I'm still working on parsing all this out. At the time being, this is just repeated info off the slide. I will provided simplication, clarifcation
and additionall information later.


`~$ ipcs`, display of the message queuer, shared memory, etc.

example output:
```
------ Message Queues --------
key        msqid      owner      perms      used-bytes   messages

------ Shared Memory Segments --------
key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
0x00000000 0          zabbix     600        576        6          dest
0x00000000 1          zabbix     600        511056     6          dest

------ Semaphore Arrays --------
key        semid      owner      perms      nsems
0x00003039  11        kresman    611        2
```
Note: if there is a semaphore outputted by this, you did something wrong. This is leaving a sempahore "hanging".

Additional comment: Kresman believes POSIX semaphores are too complicated, and created his own library. I will be disregarding this and do my best to leanr and explain POSIX semaphores.

#### POSIX Semaphores

Semaphores operate through system calls. More info is always available on the [man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/sem_overview.7.html) (or `man sem_overview).

2 categories, 


##### named semaphores

Named semaphorse are named by a c-string of a maximum length. Processes may share a named semaphore using the [sem_open(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_open.3.html) function.


##### unnamed semaphores
